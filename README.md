# Java-Music-Tools
  This is a set of tools to aid Musicians, and Music Theorists alike. It will have the ability to create scales, the properties of those scales, the chords that will come from those scales... Complex Chords... Interval Identification and creation...Figured Bass Realization...
  This program is intended to be endless in terms of what it can do for theorists and musicians alike. I just need Help, as doing this alone is really difficult.
 
 ## This program will likely include:
  1. Calculation of Custom Scales
  2. Chord Calculation
  3. Interval Calculation
  4. Transposition
